This is a web crawler written in python. It takes in a website and searches for links and stores them in a file.
The program accounts for double counting by storing the sorted values in a set.
In the future i will look to add more features such as ssl connectivity, char-set detection, and options for delays 
to avoid blacklisting.  I might extend it to a GUI in the future.
